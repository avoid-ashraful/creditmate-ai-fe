## Rate Limiting

Currently, no rate limiting is implemented (MVP phase). In production, consider:

- 1000 requests per hour per IP
- 100 requests per minute per IP
- Higher limits for authenticated users

## Data Freshness

Credit card data is automatically updated weekly through our AI-powered crawling system. Check the `updated` field for the last modification timestamp.

## Integration Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Filters**: Always filter results to minimize data transfer
2. **Implement Pagination**: Handle large result sets properly
3. **Cache Frequently Accessed Data**: Reduce API calls for common queries
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
5. **Use Search Suggestions**: Enhance user experience with autocomplete
6. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting in production
