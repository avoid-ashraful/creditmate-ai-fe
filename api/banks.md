### Get Credit Cards for a Bank

To get all credit cards offered by a specific bank, use the Credit Cards API with bank filtering:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/credit-cards/?bank=1"
# or
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/credit-cards/?bank__name=Chase"
```

## Usage Examples

### Get Active Banks Only

```bash
# Get only active banks
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/banks/?is_active=true"
```

### Search for Specific Bank

```bash
# Case-insensitive search
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/banks/?search=american+express"
```

### Recently Added Banks

```bash
# Get recently added banks (newest first)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/banks/?ordering=-created_at"
```

## Integration Notes

1. **Bank IDs are stable** - Once assigned, bank IDs do not change
2. **Credit card count is live** - The `credit_cards_count` field reflects the current number of active credit cards
3. **Search is optimized** - Bank name search uses database indexes for fast results
4. **Pagination is recommended** - Always use pagination for production applications

## Admin Features

Banks can be managed through the Django admin interface at `/admin/banks/bank/` with the following capabilities:

- Add new banks with validation
- Edit bank information
- View associated data sources
- Monitor credit card counts
- Bulk operations for multiple banks

## Data Sources Integration

Each bank can have multiple data sources (URLs) for automated credit card data crawling. This is managed through the `BankDataSource` model and is not directly exposed through the public API.

For more comprehensive API usage examples, see [API Examples](./examples.md).
