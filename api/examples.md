## Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limits implemented (MVP phase), but consider implementing proper rate limiting in production.

## Data Freshness

Credit card data is automatically updated weekly through our AI-powered web crawling system. The last update timestamp is available through the API.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Filters**: Instead of loading all data, use filters to get exactly what you need
2. **Implement Pagination**: For large datasets, always implement proper pagination
3. **Cache Responses**: Consider caching frequently accessed data
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Always implement proper error handling
5. **Use Search Suggestions**: Leverage the search suggestions endpoint for better UX

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript/React Example

```javascript
// Fetch credit cards with specific criteria
const fetchCreditCards = async (filters = {}) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(filters);
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/credit-cards/?${params}`);
  return response.json();
};

// Usage
const travelCards = await fetchCreditCards({
  search: 'travel',
  has_foreign_transaction_fee: false,
  ordering: 'annual_fee',
});
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

# Fetch credit cards
def get_credit_cards(base_url, **filters):
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/api/v1/credit-cards/", params=filters)
    return response.json()

# Usage
cards = get_credit_cards(
    "http://localhost:8000",
    search="cashback",
    annual_fee__lte=100,
    ordering="annual_fee"
)
```

### cURL Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/v1"

# Function to get credit cards with filters
get_cards() {
    local query="$1"
    curl -s "${BASE_URL}/credit-cards/?${query}" | jq '.'
}

# Get no annual fee cards
get_cards "annual_fee=0&ordering=interest_rate"

# Get travel cards
get_cards "search=travel&has_foreign_transaction_fee=false"
```
