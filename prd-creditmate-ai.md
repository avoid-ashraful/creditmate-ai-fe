- React.js with TypeScript will be used for the frontend
- Backend will be implemented using Django with Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database
- The application should be containerized using Docker for deployment
- NPM will be used for package management

## 8. Data Model

```typescript
// Core data models

interface Bank {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  logo: string;
  website: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface CreditCard {
  id: number;
  bankId: number;
