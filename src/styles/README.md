This project has been enhanced with modern styling techniques using third-party libraries to create a more visually appealing and interactive user interface.

## Libraries Used

- **styled-components**: For component-based styling with CSS-in-JS
- **framer-motion**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **react-spring**: For physics-based animations

## Key Features Added

### Gradient Styling

- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Gradient accents on cards and UI elements
- Gradient footer with improved visual hierarchy

### Animations

- Fade-in and slide-up animations for cards
- Staggered loading animations for lists
- Hover animations for interactive elements
- Spring physics for natural-feeling motion

## Usage

The styled components are located in `src/styles/StyledComponents.tsx` and can be imported and used throughout the application. The components are designed to be composable and reusable.

Example:

```tsx
import { GradientButton, AnimatedCard } from '../styles/StyledComponents';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <AnimatedCard>
    <h2>Card Title</h2>
    <p>Card content</p>
    <GradientButton>Click Me</GradientButton>
  </AnimatedCard>
);
```

## Customization

The color scheme can be customized by modifying the `colors` object in `src/styles/StyledComponents.tsx`. The animations can be customized by modifying the animation variants and keyframes.
